          <h2 class="section-heading mt-1">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The primary purpose of my usability test was to test the searching and filtering
            features of Etsy. My method was to give my three participants three
            tasks involving different items to search for, prioritizing different aspects. They were asked to
            articulate their thought process as they browsed the website, and to limit their use of the search
            bar as much as possible. The three tasks were as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>You are on a tight budget and you need at least 10 face masks of any type.</li>
            <li>You are looking for your supplies for back to school/work, and you want the highest rated
              option.</li>
            <li>You are looking for a birthday present for a friend who likes gardening.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The demographic summary of my participants:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>54 year old female business manager who spends roughly 40 hours a week online.</li>
            <li>54 year old male lawyer who spends roughly 60 hours a week online.</li>
            <li>15 year old male student who spends roughly 85 hours a week online.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Home Page</h2>
          <p>
            Etsy as a whole did not prove to have many usability issues that I could visibly see prior to testing. The
            design and UI design appeared modern and simplistic upon participants' first viewing. Large amounts of white
            space and muted colors made for pleasant browsing. It's apparent based on the photos and layout what the
            purpose and target audience was, without too much reading of text.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/etsy-home.JPG" alt="Etsy home page, image">
          <span class="caption">"intuitive", "clean", "pretty" were popular terms to describe the front page</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>
          <p>A couple of usability issues did turn up over the course of the tasks. Every one of the
            participants took note of the plethora of choices and options that are available to varying acceptance. The
            youngest enjoyed the options, whereas the older participants noted their preference for better curation and
            filtering capabilities when browsing without the search bar.
          </p>
          
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/etsy-choices.JPG" alt="Product search results page, image">
          <span class="caption">For a site selling general merchandise, Etsy does look a little cluttered</span>
          <p>Notably, the "Sort by" button was not immediately noticeable to participants on the browser based site.
            It is debatable whether this was because of the lack of need to use it or because of poor design, but it did
            take a while for it to be discovered when it was needed. Additionally, on the mobile version of the site,
            there was no option to sort by "Top Customer Reviews", which prevented easy completion of the second task.
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/no-ratings-filter.JPG" alt="Filter menu on mobile, image">
          <span class="caption">"Relevancy" also might not be the clearest criteria for sorting</span>
          <p>
            The second issue was that the quantity selection was not readily available until the checkout page. This 
            was not a big issue for most of the participants, but it did add some uncertainty for items that 
            people might want to buy in bulk.
          </p>
          
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/checkout.JPG" alt="Checkout page with quantity selected, image">
          <span class="caption">It might seem obvious that no quantity selection equals "1", but the lack of clarity
            can be a big deal for penny pinchers
          </span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Of all the findings from this usability test, a couple stood out that was shared by all participants. Every
            participant encountered some issue with either finding or utilizing the sorting feature effectively. The
            second common issue was that all participants appeared to be affected in some way by how much there was to
            look at. Although this might have been related to the design of the tasks themselves (perhaps too
            unspecific?), or the limitations in using the search bar, I still noticed several hints of participants 
            being slightly overwhelmed by the amount of options.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Moving Forward</h2>
          <p>
            I would propose more testing with revised tasks that are designed based on what I've learned from the
            results. I would make the tasks more detailed so that there is a clearer sense of what to find. Finally, I
            would test both the desktop and mobile version of the site for all participants. This would help determine
            the effectiveness of particular design elements, as well as observing the general differences in user
            experience between the two.
