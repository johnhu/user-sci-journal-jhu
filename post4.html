          <h2 class="section-heading mt-1">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            As a follow-up to previous week's usability analysis, I have tailored the same test for mobile devices. Once
            again, I am testing the search features of Etsy to determine how effectively one can find items based on
            ratings and price. The main goal is to discover usability issues that are unique to mobile devices. The
            three tasks given to test participants were:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>You are on a tight budget and you need at least 10 face masks of any type.</li>
            <li>You are looking for your supplies for back to school/work, and you want the highest rated
              option.</li>
            <li>You are looking for a birthday present for a friend who likes gardening.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The three participants ranged from young adult to middle age and all use the internet between 30-80 hours a
            week. They were guided through the tests with a screen and voice recorder.
          </p>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Home Page</h2>
          <p>
            Fortunately, the mobile version of the site did not appear to have noticeable usability issues from the
            outset. In general, the mobile site is more condensed and not as spread out as on desktop. This reduces the
            white space which gave the desktop site a more pleasant feel. The content is generally the same, although
            the "popular" items section was omitted.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/etsy-mobilehome.JPG" alt="Etsy mobile home page, image">
          <span class="caption">The site seems to get its message across more effectively like this</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>
          <p>
            Although usability problems were not apparent from the outset, I could tell that the oldest participant was
            a little overwhelmed by the thought of searching without the search bar. She was not aware of the hamburger
            button
            toggle for product category menus, and elected to using links on the front page to find what she was looking
            for.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/etsy-homechoices.jpg" alt="Product recommendations on home page, image">
          <span class="caption">The mobile site omits the Popular items but includes the "Editors' Picks" labels</span>
          <p>
            Similar to the desktop browser test, the filter button took a while to find. However, when it was found, it
            was decently useful to one participant. This participant pressed a "Gas mask card" on task 1 because it was
            the cheapest, but probably didn't look at the picture or name clearly. The name was largely obscured due to
            reduced screen real estate. There was also no easy way to filter by face mask.
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/gasmaskcard.JPG" alt="Man in Gas Mask as first search result, image">
          <span class="caption">Interesting how the user can be so focused on filtering their results that they gloss
            over the image</span>
          <p>
            One general observation was that the home button was used much less, with participants more likely to press
            forward or back arrows to navigate. This makes sense when one considers the longer page lengths. The user is
            less likely to scroll back to the top to press the logo for home.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Through this round of tests, I was able to observe a few similarities and differences between the desktop
            and mobile usability. Firstly, I could see that participants were similarly aware of the amount of options,
            but seemed to be less emotionally affected by them. The filtering features also similarly took a while to
            find, but when found, they were used more effectively as it replaced the left sidebar on the desktop site.
            There was less dependence on the home button, but also reduced likelihood of scrolling to the very bottom.
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/etsy-filter.JPG" alt="Shirts and Tees category menu, image">
          <span class="caption">This category menu is surprisingly more useful on mobile</span>
          <p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Suggestion</h2>
          <p>
            What I found was that the problems that occurred were largely related to screen real estate. Because
            products are listed in two columns instead of four, users could focus on the images a little
            better and therefore navigate more easily using just images. However, this also makes the user a bit less in
            touch with the hierarchy and
            feel less in control of the navigation. Improving the experience on mobile won't be easy due to such
            constraints, but if navigational elements were clarified in a way, I could see how general users can
            benefit.
